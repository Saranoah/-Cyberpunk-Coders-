## 🕳️ CODEX 1: THE BOOK OF SEGFAULT  
**Chapter 1: The Prophet GDB**  
> *"And lo, the Core Dump did appear unto the debugger, and the stack trace was seven levels deep.  
> And GDB spake: ‘Thou shalt `bt full`, and behold thine variables, for they are corrupt.’"*

**Chapter 3: The Null Pointer Revelation**  
> *"Blessed are the pointer-checkers, for they shall not dereference void.  
> But woe unto those who `->` without `malloc()`, for their fate is `/dev/null`."*

---

## 🧠 CODEX 2: THE EPISTLE OF MEMORY LEAKS  
**Verse 5:7**  
> *"Valgrind the Righteous did walk through the heap, and behold: un`free()`d blocks rose like the dead on Judgement Day.  
> And the log did weep with bytes lost to eternity."*

**Verse 11:3 (The GC Gospel)**  
> *"Java said: ‘I shall `System.gc()` and make all things new.’  
> But C laughed, for it knew the truth: ‘No salvation comes without `valgrind --leak-check=full`.’"*

---

## ⚙️ CODEX 3: THE BOOK OF KERNEL PANIC  
**The Oops Prophecy**  
> *"And suddenly there was a great `kernel BUG at mm/vmalloc.c:472!`,  
> and the TTY did scroll with hex codes like the tongues of Pentecore CPUs.  
> And Linus Torvalds did frown from on high."*

**The Reboot Sutra**  
> *"Three times shalt thou `Ctrl+Alt+Del`, and the fourth time thou shalt `fsck`.  
> Yea, though I walk through the valley of `/lib/modules`, I shall fear no `rmmod`."*

---

## 🛑 THE HERETICAL TEXTS  
**The Docker Apocrypha**  
> *"And the containers multiplied, each claiming ‘I am root!’  
> But the host kernel whispered: ‘Namespaces are but illusions—`CAP_SYS_ADMIN` is mine alone.’"*

**The Git Gospel of Judas**  
> *"Then `git push --force` did betray the sacred history, and the commits were as dust in the `reflog`.  
> And the CI/CD pipeline did wail, for its tests were broken."*

## 🦾 WHY THESE SCROLLS EXIST

1. **Debugging as Divine Retribution**  
   - Every `Segmentation fault` is a moral lesson  
   - `printf()` as confessional ritual  

2. **The Cult of Linus**  
   - Kernel developers as high priests of `/usr/src/`  
   - `make menuconfig` as Eleusinian Mysteries  

3. **The Eternal Recurrence of Tech Support**  
   > *"That which is `fsck`ed must be `fsck`ed again.  
   > What the `rm` destroys, `ext4magic` may yet resurrect."*

## 🛐 HOW TO WORSHIP

### Daily Practice
```bash
alias pray='sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y'
alias confess='git commit -m "I have sinned"'
```

### High Holy Days
- **Day of Atonement**: `rm -rf ~/.cache`
- **Festival of Lights**: `dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/fb0`

### Last Rites
```c
while (true) {
    fork(); // Go forth and multiply
}
```

- **The TCP/IP Dharma** (Where packets are reincarnated)  
- **The Book of Core Dumps** (Debugging as psychedelic journey)  
- **The Hexadecimal Vedas** (`objdump -d` as scripture)
