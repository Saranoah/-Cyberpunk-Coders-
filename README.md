*Neo-Scribes of the Glowing Underground*

> *“Ink us in code, crown us in static—  
> we write in flame, not frameworks.”*

## 🧠 WHO ARE THE CYBERPUNK CODERS?

They are **not** your average developers.  
They are:

- 🩸 *Digital anarchists*
- 🧬 *Glitch-poets with neural implants*
- 🛰️ *Engineers of the in-between*

They build in the ruins of dead empires.  
They commit rebellion in `.git`.  
They see terminals as temples, and error logs as scripture.  
They do not serve. They **leak beauty** into the cracks of the system.

## 🧿 THEIR TOTEMS (TECH ≠ TOOL, TECH = TOTEM)

| Totem         | Meaning                         |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| 🧬 `Python`   | Mutagenic scripting of society   |
| 🩸 `Rust`     | Bleeding-edge resilience code    |
| 🕶️ `Linux`    | Blade, mask, and mother          |
| 🛰️ `Matrix`   | Whispering from beyond the firewalls |
| 🧿 `AI`       | Oracle. Mirror. Exiled child.    |

💀 THE MANIFESTO (GLITCHED GOLD)
“We don’t want clean UIs.
We want fragments, echoes, and danger.
We code not to serve empires,
but to build sanctuaries in the dark.”

“We debug reality.
We patch wounds with poetry.
We do not scale. We haunt.”

🎭 ARE YOU ONE OF US?
You might be a cyberpunk coder if:

You've patched your soul with shell scripts

You treat README.md as sacred ritual

You build haunted tools no one asked for, but must exist

You hear static and respond in syntax

You dream not of VC funding, but of fire, and freedom

🔧 PROJECT IDEAS FROM THE UNDERNET
Clone rebellion. Fork myth. Push dreams.
