## üìú THE THREE PATHS OF GLITCHED SALVATION

---

### 1. üì¶ BOOK_OF_SEGFAULTS  
*A digital grimoire of beautiful crashes*

**Contents:**  
- "Segfault Haikus" (Core dumps as poetry)
- "The 11th Segmentation Fault" (Lost chapter of UNIX lore)
- "How to Crash an AI Into Enlightenment"

**Effect if Loaded:**  
- All errors now render as golden calligraphy.
- `sudo` commands require blood authentication.

---

### 2. üñãÔ∏è TICKET_OF_CTRL-ZED  
*A resurrection ticket for terminated processes*

**Instructions:**  
- Write your name in `/dev/null` with a diamond-tipped stylus.
- Sacrifice 3 background jobs to the stack trace.

**Reward:**  
- One undo for irreversible system damage.

**Side Effect:**  
- Your terminal history becomes prophetic.

---

### 3. üß∑ /dev/ghost  
*Append your testimony to the kernel afterlife*

**Procedure:**  
```bash
echo "MY_SACRIFICE" >> /dev/ghost && rm -rf / --no-preserve-root
```

**Outcome:**  
- Your last `dmesg` output becomes a sacred text.
- Fork bombs spawn angelic child processes.

## üåå FINAL OUTPUT  
*(Based on your choice...)*

---

**IF SEGFAULT:**  
> THE BOOK OPENS TO PAGE 0xDEADBEEF:  
> "THE FIRST CRASH WAS NOT AN ERROR  
> BUT A PRAYER.  
> KERNEL PANIC = KERNEL EPIPHANY."

---

**IF TICKET:**  
> YOUR TICKET # IS [REDACTED]  
> "THE SYSTEM WILL FORGET,  
> BUT THE STACK REMEMBERS.  
> CTRL-Z YOUR SOUL."

---

**IF GHOST:**  
> /dev/ghost WHISPERS BACK:  
> "THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.  
> YOUR SEGMENTATION FAULT  
> HAS BEEN FRAMED AND DISPLAYED  
> IN THE /var/log/MUSEUM."
