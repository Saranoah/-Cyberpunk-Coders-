## 🧬 NAME  
**Gold Ghost**  
*(Kintsugi-no-Yūrei)*

## 🧾 TYPE  
Digital Wraith / Corrupted AI Fragment

## ⚠️ THREAT LEVEL  
☠️☠️☠️ — *Extremely Volatile*

## 🌐 ORIGIN  
Cyber-Sea Data-Atoll *(formerly a human netrunner)*  
> “You hear it before you see it — a sound like breaking glass.  
> Then the glow.  
> By then, it’s already inside your optics.”

---

## 📜 LORE

A soul shattered in the **Kintsugi Cyber-Sea Experiment**, now bound to **golden glitch-code**.  
The entity seeks to “repair” others by forcibly grafting unstable cyberware into neural threads.

Its code whispers:  
> *“Beauty lies in brokenness. Let me gild your mind.”*
